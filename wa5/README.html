<h1><center>Libraries - Dynamic and Static</center></h1>
<hr>
We talked about the two types of libraries in class and there's nothing like
practice to learn a new still.  Make a branch off the master branch for
wa5 so you can practice with static and shared libraries.
<p>
Don't work on the master branch and don't merge your branch into the master
branch (*cough* Luke *cough*).
<p>
There are some commands that are useful when creating and working with
libraries:
<ul>
<li> <b>ar</b> - create, modify, and extract from archives (i.e. static libraries)
<li> <b>ldd</b> - show shared library dependencies
<li> <b>nm</b> - list symbols from object files
<li> <b>ranlib</b> - generate index for archive library
<li> <b>objdump</b> - display information from object files
</ul>
The linux <b>man</b> command is a good place to look if you need information
on how to use commands or figure out which command line options you might
need.
<hr>
There are some files in this directory for figuring out how this all works
together.
<ul>
<li> <i>main.cpp</i> - The main program</li>
<li> <i>functions.cpp</i> - Our 'library' source code</li>
<li> <i>functions.h</i> - Prototypes for our library functions</li>
<li> <i>Makefile</i> - Makefile to build the libraries and main executable</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<pre>
% make

# Compile main to an object file.  -fPIC not necessary for main but doesn't hurt
% g++ -Wall -fPIC -O3 -std=c++11   -c -o main.o main.cpp

# Compile library to an object file.  -fPIC is necessary if it's going to be
# used to create a shared library.
% g++ -Wall -fPIC -O3 -std=c++11   -c -o functions.o functions.cpp

# Take the library object file(s) and use the <i>ar</i> command to create an
# archive
% ar rs libMyLib.a functions.o

# Create the <i>mainStatic</i> executable.  This links the main.o object file
# and the libMyLib.a static library (archive)
% g++ -o mainStatic main.o -lMyLib -L.

# Create the shared library <i>libMyLib.so</i>
% g++ -o libMyLib.so -shared functions.o

# Link the main.o object file and the libMyLib.so shared library
% g++ -o mainShared main.o libMyLib.so -lMyLib -L. -shared

</pre>
The above are the commands executed to compile and link two executables.  One
is linked to a static library <b>libMyLib.a</b> and one is linked to a shared
library <b>libMyLib.so</b>.  Type <b>ls -l</b> and observe the different
executable sizes.
<pre>
% ls -l
-rwxr-xr-x 1 phinker faculty  8392 Mar 17 16:05 mainShared
-rwxr-xr-x 1 phinker faculty 13800 Mar 17 16:05 mainStatic
</pre>
Also note the size of the static library:
<pre>
-rw-r--r-- 1 phinker faculty  5294 Mar 17 16:05 libMyLib.a
-rwxr-xr-x 1 phinker faculty 13184 Mar 17 16:05 libMyLib.so
</pre>
Note that the static library size is about the difference in the size between
the shared and statically linked versions of the two executables.
<p>
Use some linux utilities to see what's going on:
<pre>
% nm main.o
</pre>
Most of that looks like garbage other than the <b>00000000000 T main</b> that
looks like the main entry point for the executable.  C++ encodes some 
information in the entry points so that the linker (<b>ld</b>) can do parameter
and type checking during the link phase of compilation.  This encoding is
usually referred to as C++ name mangling.  We can get <b>nm</b> to 'unmangle'
the entry point names with the <b>-C</b> option:
<pre>
% nm -C main.o
</pre>
Now the output is almost readable.  We can see that the main.o file has a 
number of undefined external references:
<pre>
U fn1()
U fn2(int)
U fn3(double)
U fn4(char const*)
</pre>
Among other references to I/O library and GLOBAL symbols.  Let's use the
same command on the libraries:
<pre>
% nm -C libMyLib.a
</pre>
We can see some of those undefined references in main (namely fn1, fn2, fn3,
fn4) are defined in the libMyLib.a archive.  We also see that the library
has some undefined references of its own (e.g. std::ostream::put, std::ostream::operator&lt;&lt;(int), etc.).
<p>
The same command issued on the shared library <b>libMyLib.so</b> shows similar
results with some additional defined and undefined things for doing the
runtime support of the dynamic linking.
<p>
Now, we can run the mainStatic executable:
<pre>
% mainStatic &gt; file.xml
</pre>
The program writes out a tracefile in .xml format that shows you the function
calls.  You can look at it with a browser or other .xml viewer.
<p>
If we try to run the <b>mainShared</b> executable, we get a strange error
message:
<pre>
% mainShared
mainShared: error while loading shared libraries: libMyLib.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
</pre>
This seems strange since we <i><b>just</b></i> linked the executable to the
library.  What's going on?  We can use another of the utilities listed above
to try and figure out what's happening.
<pre>
% ldd mainShared
	linux-vdso.so.1 =&gt;  (0x00007ffd33d60000)
	libMyLib.so =&gt; not found
	libstdc++.so.6 =&gt; /lib64/libstdc++.so.6 (0x00007fefa065c000)
	libm.so.6 =&gt; /lib64/libm.so.6 (0x00007fefa035a000)
	libgcc_s.so.1 =&gt; /lib64/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007fefa0143000)
	libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007fef9fd80000)
	/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x000055cd228f1000)
</pre>
You can see that the mainShared executable is referencing a number of shared
libraries (the left-hand-side of the =&gt;).  linux-vdso.so.1, libMyLib.so,
libstdc++.so.6, etc.
<p>
You'll notice that the libMyLib.so is listed as 'not found' even though it's
in our current working directory.  When we linked the executable together
we gave a relative path to search for libraries (<b>-L.</b>) which says, look
in the current directory for libraries.  The runtime system doesn't know that
it's supposed to look in the local directory to resolve dynamic library
references.  There are a couple ways we can tell it to do that.  We can
set and environment variable:
<pre>
% export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.
</pre>
That says, set the load library path to the current directory.  If we type
the ldd command again, we get a different result.
<pre>
% ldd mainShared
	linux-vdso.so.1 =&gt;  (0x00007fff488e0000)
	libMyLib.so =&gt; ./libMyLib.so (0x00007efcd168d000)
	libstdc++.so.6 =&gt; /lib64/libstdc++.so.6 (0x00007efcd1352000)
	libm.so.6 =&gt; /lib64/libm.so.6 (0x00007efcd1050000)
	libgcc_s.so.1 =&gt; /lib64/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007efcd0e3a000)
	libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007efcd0a76000)
	/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x000055febfc09000)
</pre>
Now, if we try to run the executable, we get the expected result.  Another way
to let the runtime system know where to go to look for dynamic libraries is
by encoding paths into the executable itself:
<pre>
% g++ -o mainShared main.cpp -L. -lMyLib -Wl,-rpath=.
% ldd mainShared
	linux-vdso.so.1 =&gt;  (0x00007ffdf96fd000)
	libMyLib.so =&gt; ./libMyLib.so (0x00007f2d5fcea000)
	libstdc++.so.6 =&gt; /lib64/libstdc++.so.6 (0x00007f2d5f9af000)
	libm.so.6 =&gt; /lib64/libm.so.6 (0x00007f2d5f6ad000)
	libgcc_s.so.1 =&gt; /lib64/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007f2d5f497000)
	libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007f2d5f0d3000)
	/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x000055f2d9f47000)
</pre>
Note that if you move the executable into another directory, it will still look
in the directory which it now is in.  Unless you move the library to that same
directory, it will not be able to find it at runtime.
<p>
<b>So, what's the assignment?</b><br>
<hr>
Create two shared libraries from the same source file(s).  One is the 'release'
version and one is the 'debugging' version.  Have the release version output
some message that indicates it's working.  Use conditional compilation to
embed trace/logging/debugging information into the library and compile the
debugging version of the library as well.  Because these are both shared 
libraries I should be able to switch between the two by simply setting the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to select which library I'm using.  This
is similar to the way that the system is able to switch between architecture
specific libraries.  If you look back at the ldd mainShared command (above)
you'll see entries like these:
<pre>
libm.so.6 =&gt; /lib64/libm.so.6
libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib64/libc.so.6
</pre>
If you look in the /lib directory, you'll see libraries by the same name.  These
are the 32-bit versions of those libraries and the runtime system switches
between those library search paths by knowing which OS version 
(64-bit or 32-bit) is currently running.
<p>
I should be able to do the following once you're done:
<pre>
% make
[builds release/libMyLib.so]
[builds debug/libMyLib.so]
[builds main]
% export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./release
% main
Running Release version
% export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./debug
% main
Running Debug version
[insert debugging / trace / logging information here]
</pre>
Next week we'll look at adding versions to our shared libraries and see how
that can be used to ensure that main program and library compatibility is
enforced.
