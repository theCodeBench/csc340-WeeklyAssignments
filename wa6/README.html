<h1><center>CSC 340 - Weekly Assignment 6 - Makefile Generator</center></h1>
<hr>
This week we're going to create a handy little script that will take the source
files in a directory and create a Makefile.  Many times you'll run into a 
situation where you have either written a small program that has a source
file or two and you want a standard sort of makefile because the default
make behavior isn't quite enough to do what you want.  In the spirit of saving
a day a week for the rest of your career, we're going to automate one of those
tasks.
<p>
<b>The Assignment (due Apr. 6)</b><br>
In the directory you'll find a number of source and include files as well as
a perl script named <i>buildMakefile</i> as an example.  To run the script:
<pre>
% ./buildMakefile
% make
</pre>
If you look at the generated Makefile you'll see that it has a number of
default targets.
<ul>
<li> all - makes the executable program
<li> program - makes the executable program
<li> clean - removes .o files, .d files, executable program
<li> debug - changes compilation flags and compiles the program with debug information
<li> tar - generates a tarfile that contains the source files, include files, and Makefile
<li> help - target that outputs a description of all the targets supported by the makefile
</ul>
You can write a bash script, python script, perl script, awk script, etc.  
No high level language (i.e. a compiled language) It
needs to be able to examine a directory and create a simple Makefile with,
at a minimum, targets to build the main executable, clean the directory, and
create a debuggable version of the main executable.  You can add other target
types if you want.
<p>
Make sure you test your script with zero, one, and more source / include
files.  Issue error messages for the following conditions:
<ul>
<li> No source files found
<li> No source file with main entry point found
<li> More than one file with the main entry point was found
</ul>
Work on your own branch, don't putback or merge to the master branch.
